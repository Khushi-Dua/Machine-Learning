# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! 🎉 This is where I’m documenting and sharing my hands-on learning experiences as I dive into the world of machine learning. As a beginner, I’m focusing on exploring datasets and using essential libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** to manipulate and analyze data effectively
In this repo, you’ll find:

- **Datasets:** A variety of datasets that I’m working with, from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering and visualization.
- **Data Analysis:** Using **NumPy** and **Pandas** to process, clean, and manipulate data for machine learning tasks.
- **Machine Learning Models**: As I progress, I’ll be experimenting with different algorithms (like regression, classification, clustering) and building models step-by-step.

This repo is a **work in progress**, and I’m constantly adding new projects and learning from my mistakes along the way. Whether you’re just starting your own machine learning journey or exploring new techniques, feel free to dive in, check out my code, and share feedback.

Let’s learn and grow together! 🌱 If you find something useful or interesting, don't forget to give it a ⭐. Happy learning and coding! 💻
